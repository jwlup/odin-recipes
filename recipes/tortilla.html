        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Spanish</strong> Tortilla is very different from a Mexican or Tex-Mex Tortilla. Instead of a hard or soft piece of flatbread, it is made mostly from eggs and potatoes. As a result, it contains no flour or grains at all. A Tortilla is usually eaten cold and may contain vegetables, herbs and spices to add flavour. During the French occupation of Spain under Napoleon, according to legend, the derogatory term of a "Frenchmen's Tortilla" was coined describing a simple omelette lacking the extra nutrition and flavour of the potatoes.</p>
